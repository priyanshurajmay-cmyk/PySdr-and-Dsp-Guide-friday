# 1. Introduction

## Software-Defined Radio (SDR):
Software-defined radio (SDR) is a radio communication system where components traditionally implemented in hardware are instead implemented in software on a computer or embedded system. This approach allows for a flexible, reconfigurable, and multi-functional device that can be adapted to different communication protocols and standards simply by changing the software.

# Digital Signal Processing (DSP):
DSP is the digital processing of signals, specifically radio frequency (RF) signals in the context of software-defined radio.
Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of computers and specialized processors to analyze and manipulate digital signals. While our world is full of analog signals (continuous waves like sound or light), DSP works with digital signals, which are discrete values (represented as 0s and 1s). This is the core concept behind how many modern technologies, from music players to cell phones, function.

*The main objective is to gain hands-on introduction to the areas of DSP, SDR, and wireless communication*

Technologies used in the guide
1. Codes are in python.
2. They utilize numpy.
3. Matplotlib.

# 2. Frequency Domain
*This chapter introduces the frequency domain and covers Fourier series, Fourier transform, Fourier properties, FFT, windowing, and spectrograms, using Python examples.*

The frequency domain shows how a signal is made up of different frequencies. While a signal in the time domain shows how its value changes over time, a frequency domain plot shows which frequencies are present and how strong they are. The process of converting a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain is known as the Fourier Transform. This allows you to visualize the individual sine waves that make up a complex signal.

## The time domain and frequency domain are two different ways of looking at the same signal:
In the time domain, a signal is represented by its amplitude (strength) over a period of time. Think of it like a sound wave on an oscilloscope, where you can see the wiggles go up and down over time. It's an intuitive way to see how a signal changes instantly.
